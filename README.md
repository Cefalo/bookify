Bookify enhances productivity by minimizing the time spent finding and securing meeting rooms, ensuring a smooth workflow for teams and managers alike.


### Key Features:
- **Quick Meeting Setup**: Book a room in seconds by selecting start time, seat requirements, and an optional floor preference.
- **Extend Overrunning Meetings**: Easily extend the current meeting time if no conflicts exist, or quickly book another room with a single click.
- **Floor-Specific Bookings**: For managers or teams that prefer a specific floor, the tool allows you to specify your floor while booking.
- **Efficient High-Demand Booking**: During peak periods, the tool automatically finds and books the best available room, avoiding manual searching.


### Bookify vs Google Calendar

#### 1. **Clunky Room Booking**:
Google Calendar may offer room bookings, but finding a suitable room in a large office with specific requirements (like seat capacity or floor preference) can be a pain. You end up scrolling through a bunch of rooms after checking through several dropdowns.

**Bookify** solves this by instantly booking the best available room based on your needsâ€”no endless scrolling or guesswork!

#### 2. **Overrunning Meetings? Google Calendar Isn't Built for That**:
If your meeting is running late, extending it on Google Calendar isn't exactly smooth. You'll likely have to go through the hassle of updating the event or manually finding another room when time runs out.

**Bookify** has got your backâ€”when your meeting is overrunning, you can either extend the current roomâ€™s time (if itâ€™s free) or quickly book a new one without breaking a sweat.

#### 3. **Floor-Specific Booking Is a Nightmare**:
Need a room close to your team or on a specific floor? Google Calendar makes you hunt for room locations manually, wasting time in the process.

**Bookify** makes floor-specific booking a breeze. Just input the floor you need, and voilÃ â€”a room on that floor is booked for you instantly.

#### 4. **High-Demand Periods Lead to Chaos**:
During peak times, manually searching for a free room on Google Calendar is frustrating. Rooms fill up fast, and you're left scrambling to find an available one.

**Bookify** shines here by quickly scanning room availability and securing the best available space, so you're never left without a meeting room, even during the busiest hours.

#### TL;DR: Google Calendar may get the job done, but it's clunky, slow, and inefficient when it comes to room bookings. **Bookify** offers a faster, smarter solution tailored to modern office needs, making room scheduling hassle-free.


## Use cases

#### CASE I: Quick Client Meeting Scheduling

> **Scenario**: A team member gets a sudden request to set up a meeting in a conference room.
> 
> **Action**: The team member opens the tool, selects the start time and minimum number of seats required, and optionally chooses a specific floor if needed.
> 
> **Outcome**: A suitable meeting room is booked immediately, saving the hassle of running through a bunch of options from the Google Calendar.

#### CASE II: Overrunning Meeting

> **Scenario**: A team/team member is running a meeting in a room X that exceeds the scheduled time, and they need to find another room to continue without interruptions.
> 
> **Action**: The team member opens the tool, and has the option to either increase the time of the current room (if no collisions exist) or quickly book another room with just a click.
> 
> **Outcome**: The system quickly books a room, and the team transitions smoothly without the hassle of manually browsing for room availability.

#### CASE III: Floor-Specific Room Requirement

> **Scenario**: A manager prefers to book rooms on a particular floor to maintain proximity to their team.
> 
> **Action**: The manager uses the tool, inputs the necessary seats, and specifies the floor.
> 
> **Outcome**: The tool books a room on the specified floor, optimizing convenience for the manager and their team.

#### CASE IV: Booking During a High-Demand Period

> **Scenario**: During a peak time, meeting rooms are in high demand. Manually searching for a room would take time.
> 
> **Action**: The user enters their seat requirements and start time. The tool searches and books the best available room.
> 
> **Outcome**: A room is secured swiftly, even in high-demand periods, preventing frustration and delays.
